# Auth-Secure-Google-VB.NET
google authenticator (VB.NET)

This project was a desperate move to get an autheticator on my computer after my phone was stolen, but I still had the keys to continue. This software is free for opnions modifications and distributions. Below I will leave the DLLs I used and the theme, and photos. Thank you and good use.
